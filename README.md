# millikan
Millikan oil drop experiment performed to measure elementary electric charge (charge of one electron) . Wrote a histogram plotting program in ROOT (C++) to map the distribution of data and fit it a four-peak Gaussian function to determine elementary charge. See report.pdf for complete description of experiment.
